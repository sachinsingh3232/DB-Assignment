1. The "Product" and "Product_Category" models represent a one-to-many relationship. This means that one product category can have multiple products associated with it, but each product belongs to only one product category.

2. To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can use a foreign key constraint. This constraint will ensure that the value in the "Product_Category" of the "Product" table references a valid category in the Product_Category" table.
